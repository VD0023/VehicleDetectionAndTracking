# Project Documentation: Vehicle Detection and Tracking

*Note: This documentation provides an overview of the project "Vehicle Detection and Tracking" using Python. It explains the purpose, functionality, and implementation details of the code.*

## 1. Introduction

The Vehicle Detection and Tracking project aims to detect and track vehicles in a real-time video stream using computer vision techniques. It utilizes OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, for implementing vehicle detection using a Haar cascade classifier.

## 2. Project Overview

The Vehicle Detection and Tracking project focuses on developing a system that can identify vehicles within a video feed and track their movement. The project uses a Haar cascade classifier, a machine learning-based object detection method, to detect vehicles in each frame of the video stream.

The project consists of the following components:

### 2.1. Data Collection

To train the Haar cascade classifier, a large dataset of vehicle images is required. The dataset should include images with vehicles from various angles, scales, and orientations. The dataset is used to train the classifier to recognize different vehicle patterns.

### 2.2. Haar Cascade Classifier

The Haar cascade classifier is a machine learning-based approach for object detection. It uses a set of pre-defined features and a trained model to identify objects within an image. In this project, the `cars.xml` file contains the trained model for vehicle detection.

### 2.3. Vehicle Detection Algorithm

The vehicle detection algorithm is implemented using the OpenCV library. The algorithm performs the following steps for each frame of the video stream:

1. Capture the frame from the webcam or video source.
2. Resize the frame to a fixed width to optimize processing.
3. Convert the frame from color to grayscale.
4. Apply the Haar cascade classifier to detect vehicles within the frame.
5. Draw bounding boxes around the detected vehicles.
6. Display the frame with the bounding boxes indicating the detected vehicles.

### 2.4. Vehicle Tracking

The project currently focuses on vehicle detection rather than tracking. However, the detected vehicles' coordinates can be stored in a data structure and further processing can be implemented to track the vehicles' movement across multiple frames.

## 3. Implementation

The provided Python code `main_webcam_code.py` implements the vehicle detection algorithm using the Haar cascade classifier. The code utilizes the OpenCV library to capture frames from the webcam, detect vehicles using the trained classifier, and display the frames with bounding boxes around the detected vehicles.

The key steps involved in the implementation are as follows:

1. Importing the necessary libraries, including OpenCV and `imutils` for image processing and resizing.
2. Loading the Haar cascade classifier using the `cars.xml` file.
3. Initializing the webcam or video source for capturing frames.
4. In a continuous loop:
   - Read a frame from the webcam or video source.
   - Resize the frame to a fixed width for optimal processing.
   - Convert the frame from color to grayscale.
   - Apply the Haar cascade classifier to detect vehicles in the frame.
   - Draw bounding boxes around the detected vehicles.
   - Display the frame with the bounding boxes.
   - Print the number of detected vehicles and analyze the traffic condition based on the count.
   - Exit the loop if the 'Esc' key is pressed.
5. Release the webcam or video source and close all windows.

## 4. Usage

To use the project for vehicle detection and tracking:

1. Ensure that you have Python and the required libraries, including OpenCV, installed on your system.
2. Download the `cars.xml` file, which contains the trained model for vehicle detection.
3. Run the `main_webcam_code.py` script.
4. The script will open a window displaying the webcam feed with

 bounding boxes around the detected vehicles.
5. The console will display the number of detected vehicles and provide traffic analysis based on the count.
6. Press the 'Esc' key to stop the execution of the script.

## 5. Conclusion

The Vehicle Detection and Tracking project provides a foundation for detecting and tracking vehicles in real-time using computer vision techniques. By leveraging the Haar cascade classifier and OpenCV library, the project enables the identification of vehicles within a video stream and the visualization of their locations through bounding boxes.

Further enhancements can be made to implement vehicle tracking across multiple frames and integrate the project into larger systems such as autonomous driving or traffic monitoring applications.
